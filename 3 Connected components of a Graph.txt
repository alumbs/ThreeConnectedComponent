Project Proposal
-----------------

Connectivity, 3-Connected Components
Code an algorithm for finding separating pairs, and use it to construct the 3-connected components of a graph.

- My goal will be to perform some initial research on 3-connected components of a graph to determine what has already been done
- Next I will try to find out some nice properties that will help me identify 3-connected components in a graph
- Finally, I will either create a new algorithm to find the 3-connected components or work on optimizing an already existing algorithm using the nice properties about 3-connected components I find
